- [Project structure](https://github.com/Odex64/SFR/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md#project-structure)

## Setup

You will need the following programs

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with ".NET Desktop development" and .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK installed.
- [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Fork this repo.

**Clone** your forked repository and open its solution with Visual Studio, then wait for NuGet to install all the required dependencies.

Right click on SFR project and choose properties; then change your configuration from `Active` to `All Configurations`.
In the `Debug` section change your working directory to your SFD installation (by default `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Superfighters Deluxe`); and external program to `SFR.exe` (must be in the same directory).

**NOTE:** if you don't have a `SFR.exe` to select, create a dummy file and chose that as external program.

If you have installed SFD in another directory or drive, you must modify `build.bat` as well. You need to change `SFD` variable with your actual installation path.

One last step is to create a `SFR` folder inside your Superfighters Deluxe installation, and manually copy `Core.dll` and `Content` folder from Superfighters Redux solution to the newly created folder.

You can open `Core.dll` with dnSpy in order to inspect SFD code. It is a slightly modified and non-obfuscated `Superfighters Deluxe.exe` assembly.
Now in Visual Studio try to build the solution, if you don't see any errors you're good to go!

## Speeding up loading times

Fast builds & loading times is an important part of the development, especially if you have to frequently restart the game.

### Game settings

First of all, start SFD/SFR normally and low the settings as much as possible, also make sure to set music volume to 0 and port forwarding to manual.

### More settings

Now open `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\config.ini` and set the following settings

```
WAIT_FOR_DEVICE=0
ENABLESCREENSHOTS=0
SHOW_MENU_GAME_PREVIEW=0
GAMEPAD_INPUT_DISABLED=1
HOST_GAME_IGNORE_SCRIPTS_WHILE_WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS=1
```

I also recommend to set
`TARGETFPS=144`
or higher if your screen has higher refresh rate, to avoid to use too much GPU.

### Startup arguments

You must use the following program arguments when developing mods `-SFR -SKIP`
It will start SFR without asking & skip updates.

If you want to start the game even faster and immediately load into a map inside map editor, you can use this special argument
`-DEBUG <PATH_TO_MAP_WITHOUT_EXTENSION>`

example: `-SFR -SKIP -DEBUG C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\Maps\Custom\Debug`.
